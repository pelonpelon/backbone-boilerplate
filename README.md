Backbone Boilerplate
====================

This boilerplate is the product of much research and frustration.  Existing
boilerplates freely modify Backbone core, lack a build process, and are very
prescriptive; Backbone Boilerplate changes that.

The Backbone Boilerplate is a way of organizing a web application with some
opinionated defaults: such as Backbone, Lo-Dash, jQuery, RequireJS, Bower,
Grunt, and the HTML5 Boilerplate styles.

Organize your application with a logical file structure, develop your
Models/Collections/Views/Routers inside modules, and build knowing you have
efficient code that will not bottleneck your users.

## Getting started ##

The easiest way to get started is to install Git and clone the repository:

``` bash
# Make a project directory and enter it.
mkdir my-project ; cd my-project

# Using Git, fetch only the latest commits.  You won't need the full history
# for your project.
git clone --depth 1 git@github.com:backbone-boilerplate/backbone-boilerplate.git .
```

You will need to download and install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) if you want
to use the commands in the following sections.

## Updating dependencies ##

Third party packages may update independently from this main repo, so it's a
good idea to update after fetching.  There are two different package managers
that you need to install and call update on.

``` bash
# Install Bower.  Depending on your user account you may need to gain
# elevated privileges using something like `sudo`.
npm install bower -gq

# Install NPM and Bower dependencies (Bower is hooked up in package.json).
npm install -q
```

## Build process ##

The build process consists of numerous Grunt plugin tasks that work together
to optimize your application.

``` bash
# Make sure you install grunt-cli globally.  Depending on your user account you
# may need to gain elevated privileges using something like `sudo`.
npm install grunt-cli -gq

# To run the build process, run the default Grunt task.
grunt

# To test that the build process works.
grunt server:release
```
